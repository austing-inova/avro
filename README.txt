** This forked repository has been modified to add Python 3.x compatability to Avro, so far, the following files have been fixed:
schema.py
io.py
datafile.py


The associated tests for these files were also fixed and are passing.

Also moved the setup.py file into the base directory so that the module can be pip installed via:
pip install git+git://github.com/austing-inova/avro.git@trunk#egg=avro
